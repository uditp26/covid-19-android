    <string name="faq_para1">The idea of using plasma from survivors, also known as convalescent-plasma therapy, dates back to the late 19th century. Doctors have transfused the blood of recovered patients into those still sick with the 1918 flu, measles, polio, chickenpox, SARS, and Ebola to varying degrees of success. Given the dearth of treatments for COVID-19, convalescent plasma has gained new prominence. The blood of survivors, the thinking goes, contains proteins called antibodies that can neutralize the corona virus.</string>

We  are  also  trying  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  patients  to connect to hospitals for blood transfusion. Ifyou give your phone number and you have volunteered to donate blood for the treatment of patients, we will provide your phone number to hospital. Hence you will get a call from the hospital. If you have given your phone number for receiving blood, you will get a call from hospitals who have the facility for blood transfusion</string>
